    [Cisco Sample Code License](https://developer.cisco.com/site/license/cisco-sample-code-license/)


    ## Status
    These are the status icons for the requests so far.
    - âŒ— : must create resources to test
    - ðŸš§ : incomplete | untested
    - ðŸ›‘ : unsupported | bug

    ## Environment Variables
    This collection uses environment variables in scripts in the **Tests** tab to store data (`id`, `name`, `portalId`, etc.)  between requests. This allows you to `GET` or `POST` then immediately `GET {id}` on a resource. Using **No Environment** will cause this convenience functionality to fail so be sure to choose one.

    ## Collection Variables
    This collection includes some default variables that you will want to update or override with environment variables for your ISE deployment. Specifically, you will want to set:
    - `ise_pxg`: the ISE PAN node name or IP address. Default: `ise.securitydemo.net`
    - `rest_username`: the username for ERS API access. Must be a member of **SuperAdmin**, **ERSAdmin** or **ERSOperator** groups. Default: `admin` which is the ISE SuperAdmin
    - `rest_password`: Default: `C1sco12345`
