### script/installdeps

[`script/installdeps`][installdeps] Install the dependencies for this project.

### script/clean

[`script/clean`][clean] Clean the project directory

This script implements a `--deep` command line option that "deep cleans" the system removing all artifacts created by the project (virtual environments and all).

### script/setup

[`script/setup`][setup] Set up the project or reset it to an initial state.

This is typically run after an initial clone, or, to _reset_ the project back to its _initial state_. [`script/clean`][clean] and [`script/installdeps`][installdeps] are run inside this script.

### script/update

[`script/update`][update] Update the project's dependencies.

### script/test

[`script/test`][test] Run the test suite for this project.

This script implements `lint`, `tests`, and `ratelimiting` command line options to enable you to select and run only the code linting or the package tests (by default, both are run when you execute `script/test` without any command line arguments).


### script/build

[`script/build`][build] Build this project's product(s).

### script/ci

[`script/ci`][ci] Continuous integration script.

### script/console

[`script/console`][console] Open a console for the project.
